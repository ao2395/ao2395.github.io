# What If Newton Ate Gravity?  

This project is an interactive comic that originated from the meme shown below:

From there, we started brainstorming ideas and came up with the concept of Newton eating an apple, and, in doing so, accidentally consuming gravity itself. The concept sketch is shown below:

### Development Process  

Implementing the concept was actually very fun, especially working with Illustrator. Every member of the team contributed to different elements, and together, we compiled everything into the story we envisioned.  

- **My role**: Backend development (handling interactions, transitions, and logic)  
- **Amelia & Raghd**: Frontend development (bringing visuals to life, structuring the pages)  
- **Abdullah**: Illustrator work (creating the core visuals and art assets)  

Doing this project alone would’ve been *painful*, but the collective effort made the entire process enjoyable and much easier than expected.  

### Lessons Learned  

To be honest, I personally learned a very important lesson from this: *set your goals in a realistic way*. I had ridiculously high expectations at first—I wanted to implement morphing animations, and I wanted the transitions to be **scroll-based** rather than **click-based**, something like [Every Last Drop](http://everylastdrop.co.uk).  

But reality hit. We had to make trade-offs. And honestly? That’s okay. I learned to **manage expectations**, and in the end, the results still turned out exactly as we wanted—just in a way that actually made sense for our timeline and scope.
